#Perform image segmentation on one of the eight image thematic subsets. Note that each file has a name starting with 
#a number from 1 to 8, which indicates the thematic subset, followed by the rest of the file name.
#I suggest to use image subsets “1_*” or “2_*”.  Use the normalized cut algorithm to perform image segmentation.
#You are welcome to confront the result with kmeans segmentation algorithm if you wish.
